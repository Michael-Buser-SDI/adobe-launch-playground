# adobe-launch-playground

This repository requires [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (the nodejs installer includes npm).

To use this repository you will need to create a .env file based on the .env.defaults file included in the repository and a private.key file with your private key for your Adobe IO connection (your adobe IO connection should also have the other required fields). Both files need to be placed in this directory.

After that is finished you should run npm install in this directory.

Finally you should be ready to run the script with the npm start command.
